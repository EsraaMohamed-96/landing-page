                        have inspired art. Paintings, sculptures, carvings,
                        musical pieces, dance forms, and many more aspire to communicate and reflect in their art form,
                        the characters, stories and the feelings that stories impart. As time passes,
                        new art forms emerge recreating and introducing new perspectives of old stories.
                        So here's a modern attempt at retelling the story of a timeless epic.
                        A cataclysmic war that went on to be hailed as the victory of righteousness…
                        of good over evil. A tale of love, ambition, loyalty, honour and above all… righteousness.</p>

                            <p>King of <span class="red">Ayodhya</span> , has sentenced his son Rama to a 14 years
                                Exile. Rama along with his wife SIta and half-brother Laxman, went on to the bordering
                                forest to serve the exile. Life in the forest seemingly went well for the three until
                                one fine day. Traversing across, Surpanakha, a demoness, spotted Rama and gotenamoured
                                with him. Rama refused her advances by stating his marital status and suggested Laxman
                                who maintained a disinterested stance.
                                The offended demoness lashed out at Sita which resulted in Laxman cutting off her nose.
                            </p>
                            <p>Surpanakha then fled to her brother, Ravana and complained of her mistreatment. The
                                angered demon king set out to take revenge. Using the ruse of a demon disguised as a
                                golden deer, Ravana ensured the brothers left Sita alone. After luring Sita out of the
                                hut by playing on her kind nature,
                                he kidnapped and took her away to his kingdom, <span class="red">Lanka.</span> </p>
                            <p>The brothers, upon realising the ruse, rushed back to their home to find it empty. On
                                setting out to find Sita, the brothers encountered and enlisted the help of Hanuman and
                                subsequently
                                the 'Vanara'army to help in the war to be waged against the Rakshasas.</p>
                            <p>Even as Ramayana ends with Rama winning the war, the focus of the story is on the virtues
                                and flaws of the heroes, the villains and the key characters.
                                The ARC collection is a digital representation of these characters.</p>
